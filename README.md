# TimesTables

Practice times tables
and play with VSCode, GitHub and a little code...

Not as concise and elegant as the ABCs original...
It's hard to stay lean while giving into some feature creep. Good lesson in itself. 
I needed an excuse to get my slightly older kiddo to a) practice times tables, and b) start to code
So now she fires up VSCode and PowerShell for 10min a day... 

Next turn of the crank will be a bit more verbose, though perhaps a bit more fun with variation in accolades
