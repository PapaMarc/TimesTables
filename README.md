Practice times tables
and play with VSCode, GitHub and a little code... 

inspired by, and built upon the wonderful foundation provided by:

LearnTimesTables.ps1 is NOT as concise and elegant as the ABCs original...  
It's hard to stay lean while giving into some feature creep. Great lesson in itself.  
That said, I needed an excuse to get my slightly older kiddo to a) practice times tables, and b) to get familar with a coding environment and code.  
So here wer are... and now she's firing up VSCode and PowerShell for 10min a day...

To attempt to hold attention for a couple extra rounds... i added some variation in accolades as suggested by u/_lahell_  https://www.reddit.com/user/_lahell_/ (and she's played around further with those getting some hands on modifying those arrays ;-). Also, added an additional case as she did some ad-hoc testing and initially broke it by typing 'lol ;-)' rather than and integer between 1-12, or <Enter>... so now when she does that she gets the real meat of the study exercise and gets thrown only Tables 6-9. 

If you're not sure how to run PowerShell Scripts... start by putting the .ps1 file in your Documents folder, and put the shortcut link on your desktop and you should be able to kickoff the script by launching the shortcut.

Enjoy.
