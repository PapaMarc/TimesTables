# Not as concise and elegant as the original...
# It's hard to stay lean while giving into some feature creep. Good lesson in itself. 
# I needed an excuse to get my slightly older kiddo to a) practice times tables, and b) start to code
# So now she fires up VSCode and PowerShell for 10min a day...

# Next turn of the crank will be a bit more verbose, though perhaps a bit more fun with variation in accolades
