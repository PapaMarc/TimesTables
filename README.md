LearnTimesTables.ps1 is NOT as concise and elegant as the ABCs original...
It's hard to stay lean while giving into some feature creep. Great lesson in itself. 
That said, I needed an excuse to get my slightly older kiddo to a) practice times tables, and b) start to code
So a few tweaks from me now facilitate her firing up VSCode and PowerShell for 10min a day...

An additinal turn of the crank is a bit more verbose, though perhaps will hold attention for a couple extra rounds with with variation in accolades
