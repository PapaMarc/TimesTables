# This next one i'm going to keep appending... so rather than
#   $Array_KeepScore += 1     (or 0 for a wrong answer)
# for each new correct answer which would lead PS to create a new array
# and then copy all old elements into it and append the new one... i'm going to use an ArrayList which
# should allow me to more efficiently append to the existing list with
#   [void]($ArrayList_KeepScore.Add(1))     (or 0 for a wrong answer)
# more/less per: https://pscustomobject.github.io/powershell/Add-Remove-Items-From-Array/
# BUT WAIT... there's more, so don't use this either:
#   $ArrayList_KeepScore =[System.Collections.ArrayList]@()
# on further investigation, looks like 'ArrayList' may be deprecated soon, in favor of 'List'
# see: https://vexx32.github.io/2020/02/15/Building-Arrays-Collections/
# so instead use this:
[System.Collections.Generic.List[int]]$list_KeepScore = @()
# and fyi... from PS5.1 and up this shorter version works:   [List[int]]$list_KeepScore = @()

# define a hash table, and a special case at that-- an 'ordered dictionary'
# will add an entry each time a problem is missed
$ht_missed = [System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary]@{}

# define variable(s) as well
# play for
$nMin = 10
#Feel free to replace $env:USERNAME with a name in quotes eg. "Jane"

# Note: if you're attempting to execute this in PowerShell6 or PowerShell7 you won't hear anything
